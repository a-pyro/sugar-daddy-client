# 🎂 Sugar Daddy Bakery 🍰
We're working on a super sweet project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the Sugar Daddy Bakery 🍰

Our main feature is managing all the delicious treats, which include a name and a price, and a list of ingredients (optional with specified quantities and units of measure) 🍰🍪🍩

But that's not all, we also have a back office area 🔒 where only Luana and Maria (or whoever is managing the bakery) can access through email and password to manage and put the treats on sale with a certain availability 📊. 
As time goes by, treats will age 🕰️ and the price will change accordingly 💰. After the fourth day, they will no longer be tasty and will have to be removed from the sale. 🚫

But don't worry, everyone can check out our showcase page 🛍️ to see the list of available treats and their relative prices. Plus, as a bonus, you can check out the details of a treat (or through an overlay) 📝 to see the recipe ingredients.

Who's ready to try some yummy treats from Sugar Daddy Bakery? 🍰🍩🧁

🛠️ Possible developements:
- User login
- Imoprove UI (Build one actually 😂)
- Make it a portal for every sweet shop to show their products
- Integrate GPT api to give the user an AI step by step recipes based on the ingredients.
